**Backstory**

When I owned a jewelry shop, one of the most time-consuming tasks at the end of every month was handling accounts payable. This meant cross-referencing every credit card payment a tedious, error-prone process when done by hand.

After returning to school and learning Python, one of my first goals was to find a better way to handle this problem. I started with Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries but quickly realized they werenâ€™t enough â€” thatâ€™s when Pandas came into the picture. With guidance from our accountant on what information was most relevant, the application began to take shape.

The result was a tool that automatically reads credit card statements, sorts and categorizes each transaction using the item codes defined by the credit card company, and generates visual summaries. It turns hours of manual sorting into minutes â€” and because accountants apparently hate pie charts, thatâ€™s the default visualization.
